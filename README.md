### Bikeshare Data Analysis
This project will explore data related to bike share systems in Python to for three major cities in the United States - Chicago, New York City, and Washington

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. 
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. 
This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if theyâ€™d like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

In this project, I will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. I will compare the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.
### Files used
Data for three cities were provided by Motivate company as csv files.
